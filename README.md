# Credit-card-fraud-detection

A  model that uses a deep neural network to identify fraudulent transactions in real-time. 
The model was trained on a large dataset of credit card transactions, both fraudulent and legitimate, and was able to accurately identify fraudulent transactions with a high degree of precision.

The model is build using deep learning framework TensorFlow to construct a neural network with multiple hidden layers, which allowed the model to learn complex patterns in the transaction data. I used feature engineering techniques to extract relevant features from the transaction data, and then fed the features into the neural network as input. 
The network then learned to classify the transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate based on the input features.

The credit card fraud detection deep learning model was highly effective in improving the accuracy and speed of fraud detection, as it was able to quickly process large volumes of transaction data in real-time. The model was also able to adapt and learn from new types of fraud patterns as they emerged, which helped to improve its overall effectiveness over time. 

Overall, the credit card fraud detection deep learning project was highly successful in improving the security of credit card transactions and reducing the incidence of fraud.
